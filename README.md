## Introduction
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) focused on deriving business insights for a new movie studio. Our goal is to analyze film data and provide actionable recommendations to help guide the studioâ€™s content creation strategy based on what types of films perform well at the box office. This analysis seeks to provide strategic advice to a new movie studio by examining trends in movie success. As the entertainment industry evolves, more studios and streaming services are focusing on original content, making it crucial to understand what drives box office performance. By identifying patterns and trends in various data sets, this analysis aims to help the studio create films that are likely to be financially successful.
